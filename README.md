Angle of Arrival implementation using MUSIC algorithm

Coming soon. A python implementation uses MUSIC algorithm to calcuate angle of arrival. The implementation is very flexible. It can support L-shape, Uniform Circular Array(UCA), Uniform Rectangular Array(URA) and more antenna geometries. It calcuate both Azimuth and Elevation angles.
